Woot-off Sirens
===============

Just a simple driver for an Arduino-driven pair of Woot-off sirens I got for cheap.

I can put up a circuit diagram if necessary, but basically it drives a pair of relays attached to pins 4 and 5 that switch a connection to a old wall wart I sacrificed for the project.

Installation:
-------------
Copy config.yml.example to config.yml, update it with your Hudson and site URLs, and run `./monitor.rb config.yml`
